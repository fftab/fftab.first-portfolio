# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

```

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, I will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 

My first experience using Bootstrap to build a web application was incredibly informative and gave me a small sense of achievement as I saw it come together. While it was challenging, I really enjoyed this assignment.

### Requirements

```

* Using Bootstrap, I created my own portfolio site fulfilling the following items:

   * A navbar.

   * A responsive layout.

   * Responsive images.
   
   * Contains the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.
   
   * Functional, deployed application using Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).
   
   * On an `xs` screen, content takes up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, there are margins on the left and right sides of the screen.
   
   * GitHub repository with README describing the project.

```

### Bonus

```

* Using Bootstrap, I made a sticky footer.

* I used sub-rows and sub-columns on my portfolio site.
